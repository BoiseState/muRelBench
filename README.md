# Î¼RelBench #

A set of synthetic benchmarks for relational abstract domains and their
operations.

## Dependencies ###

The main requirements for muRelBench are OpenJDK version 11, and Maven 3.x.
Please install these tools through your preferred method.

If you use [Guix][guix], then please use the following command to load into a
temporary environment for building and developing muRelBench:

```bash
guix time-machine -C channels.scm -- shell -m manifest.scm
```

### Docker Image ###

Currently, the container image is built using [Guix Pack][guix-pack].
Therefore, without using [Guix][guix] it is not possible to build the container
image.  However, if you have OpenJDK 11 and Maven, then everything should work
all the same.

## Building ##

After installing dependencies, building the project is as simple as invoking
Maven:

```bash
mvn package
```

The `package` goal will create a `target/benchmarks.jar` file, which is the
main entry-point of executing benchmarks.

## Running ##

To execute the benchmarks, the following command should be sufficient:

```bash
java -jar target/benchmarks.jar
```
